        <p>Hello and thank you for stopping by.</p>
        <p>My name is Galina Malkova. My family and I came to the United States from Belarus (Europe) five years ago.
            Moving here has been one of the biggest challenges in my life.</p>
        <p>I liked making handcrafted items since I was a child. I am able to do various kinds of needlework, including
            sewing, knitting, crocheting, cross-stitching, scrapbooking, decoupage, handcrafting jewelry, and etc., and
            I often use several of them at once while working on an item.</p>
        <p>I prefer sewing and creating unique handmade items which keep the warmth and inspiration of mine.
            Handcrafting inspires me and helps me feel more comfortable in a new country. Who knows, maybe, one day my
            hobby will become my job.</p>
        <p>I would appreciate any comments/reviews regarding my work.</p>
        <p>Best Wishes,<br>
            Galina.</p>
